# This is biorhytm calculator. 

### **TL;DR**: this is roughly an approximation of what you life depends on, so feel free to leave this repo whilst skeptically smiling.

### As you can read at [relevant wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorhythm), biorhythms - is an **attempt** to predict various aspects of a person's life through simple mathematical cycles. The theory was developed by Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19th century, and was popularized in the United States in late 1970s. 


### I started to check on it every time I experienced strong emotional bursts or states f.e. felt excited, depressed etc., and it was always corresponding with the biorhytm calculated back then. Unfortunately all calculators are created for ads, so I decided to build my own.
